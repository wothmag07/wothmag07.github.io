Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a graduate student at Oregon State University, pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence. My work focuses on building intelligent systems that are not only accurateâ€”but also scalable, efficient, and production-ready.

Before grad school, I was an Associate Technical Architect at NPCI, where I deployed models in production, and built fault-tolerant DevOps infrastructures for large-scale financial systems. That experience sparked my deep interest in MLOps, cloud-native architectures, and reliable system design.

These days, Iâ€™m working on everything from real-time AI applications (like lip-sync video synthesis) to infrastructure automation with Kubernetes and Terraform, and exploring how LLMs can be integrated into enterprise pipelines.

Iâ€™m on a mission to make machine learning faster to develop, easier to deploy, and resilient in production.

Thanks for visiting my space!
